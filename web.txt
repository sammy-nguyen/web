==> How does the Internet work?

Internet is the global network that connects all computers on the world. The Internet
purpose is moving data from one place to another, so we can communicate, chat, browse
and share everything. Internet works by using packet router that folows IP ( a unique
address to find that computer on the network) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol
which is one of the main protocols of the Internet Protocol suite).

When you click on the link, the browser and operating system figure out where you've
clicked. The websites have their own hidden information associated with whatever you
clicked on, that is called Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Then, your browser takes
that URL,break out the name of the website, after that using the DNS (Domain Name System,
used totranslate the IP to host name) to get IP (Internet Protocal). Then, the browser
opens TCP connect to the website over IP. It wants to meet HTTP or HTTPS server which
will provide the next web page in HTML, CSS,Javascript, images, and videos that the
browser render.
